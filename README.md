Learning About Linux - gulsaifi

Introduction

This paper will be, in general, a detail about Linux, its development in historical aspects, different distributions available, and some basic commands that comprise it. It must suffice for anyone interested in venturing into the world of Linux.

Section 1: Linux History

Linux, as a free and open-source operating system kernel, came into being in 1991 when Linus Torvalds developed it at the University of Helsinki. Since then, it has grown from those humble beginnings of just a few C files into this huge code base supported by an active worldwide community of developers. The founder, Linus Torvalds, is still tied in closely to the activity of maintaining it.
Linux has become an indispensable part of the contemporary computing world; it drives everything from servers to desktops, smartphones to supercomputers. Because it is open source, innovations and adaptations don't ever cease in these very disparate technological landscapes.

Section 2: Linux Distros
Linux distributions, also called "distros," are complete operating systems built on top of the Linux kernel. They contain all the essential components: the bootloader, initialization system, graphical server, and applications. Some popular distributions include :

Ubuntu: friendlier with its interface and enjoys the best community support.
Debian: famous for stability and the huge amount of software available.
Fedora: Of the very latest, it's also a testing bed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
Arch Linux: Favored for being very simple and highly customizable.
Each distribution serves a different purpose, either for out-of-the-box usefulness or heavily tuned for total power, and there are differences in package management and default software.

Part 3: Simple Linux Commands
Mastering basic Linux commands is essential for efficient system navigation and management. Key commands include:

ls: Lists the files and directories.
cd: Changes the current directory.
pwd: shows the current working directory.
mkdir: It creates a new directory.
cp: It copies the files/directories. mv: rename files or directories, or move files. rm: Removes files or directories. sudo: Run a command as the superuser. These commands are fundamental for working with a Linux command line.
